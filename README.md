# Minishell spliting into two main things : 
---
# Parcing
 
Most of the recomandations are to start the parcing:
1. Check for quotes (handle quotes) - asta ziceau cativa() || Tokenizeing - si asta am auzit() 
2. Special charact ()
3. Syntax Errors
4. Signal work

# Execution

EXECUTION = Most of execution is about PIPEX (asta ziceau cam 90% din ce am auzit, si legat de execution ii foarte stufos, am vb cu Nikola sa ne explice amandurora, cam toti ne au zis cand facem aia sa o intelegem deodata)

In order to do the bonus, we need to consider that from now(everyone is saying how hard it is without) (eu nu vreau(Tudor)ca dureaza extrem de mult)

# Toughts

-Based on what I got from today I would say best the approach for both of us is PARCING
